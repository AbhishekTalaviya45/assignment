        My Thoughts about life journey of late Rishi Kapoor and Irfan Khan</u></p>

        <p align="middle" style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;"><b><u> Rishi Kapoor </u></b>
    <p style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rishi kapoor is a very versatile and determined actor. I remember his first Movie was <b>"Mera nam joker"</b> where he started his carrier and never stop after that and he got his first film fare award in his first movie in 1970.</p>

    <p style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rishi Kapoor made his debut from his father’s movie ”Mera Naam Joker” in 1970 where he played the childhood of Raj Kapoor. For his debut film, he also received the National Film Award. After starring as a kid, his first leading role was in the 1973 film, “Bobby” opposite Dimple Kapadia. The film became one of the decade’s biggest hits. Rishi Kapoor said in an interview in 2012, “There was a misconception that the film was made to launch me as an actor. The film was actually made to pay the debts of Mera Naam Joker. Dad wanted to make a teenage love story and he did not have money to cast Rajesh Khanna in the film”.After “Bobby”, he went on to star as a romantic lead in 92 films between 1973 and 2000. Some of the popular films include Khel Khel Mein (1975), Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Karz (1980), and Chandni (1989) etc.</p>

    <p style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2018, Rishi Kapoor was diagnosed with Leukemia which is a blood cancer that begins with bone marrow.He died on April 30, early morning. My condolences is with his family.</p>
            
    <p align="middle" style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;"><b><u> Irfan Khan </u></b>
    <p style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When i heard name of Irfan khan, only one thing comes In my mind which is he is inspiration to many youngers like me. He was hard worker. widely considered to be one of the finest actors in the Hindi film industry, even he acted role in television and hollywood also.</p>
        
        <p style="color: lavender; font-size: 30px;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favourite movies of irfan khan is <b>Hindi Medium</b> and <b>Lunch Box</b>. he was a natural actor and He become an actor by chance. personally, he wanted to be a cricketer and was very passionate about the same but his parents did not appreciate his carrer so irfan khan was tougher person from inside.
